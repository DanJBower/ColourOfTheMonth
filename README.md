# Colour Of The Month

This is a really simple Android app that displays a different colour each month.

The app is automatically kept up to date by a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on the first day of each month.

I'm not going to lie, I created this app to prevent my Android developer account from getting de-activated ðŸ™‚

## TODOs

* Create the app using Kotlin and JetPack Compose
* Background should be colour of the month
* Foreground should be a box with text in
* Initially should contain just the name of the colour
* Tapping it should expand the box over a second or something to show additional information:
  * HEX value
  * RGB value
  * HSL value
  * HSV value
* If animation too complicated just make it an immediate change
* Further taps toggle between the two boxes
