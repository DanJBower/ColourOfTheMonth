# Colour Of The Month

**Credit:** All colour names and colour codes were taken from [HTML COLOR CODES](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names/) on 27/05/2024.

This is a really simple Android app that displays a different colour each month.

The app is automatically kept up to date by a GitHub Actions workflow that runs on the first day of each month.

I'm not going to lie, I created this app to prevent my Android developer account from getting de-activated ðŸ™‚
